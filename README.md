# wifi2017
Mr. Blinky Bling WiFi sniffing badge for 2017

Some helpful notes for working with this code:

This badge works in the Arduino IDE with the Board set to "Arduino Leonardo" and all the files in the "wifi2017" folder.

You will need to install two libraries for the Arduino IDE in order to compile the code.  This is easy to do:

Select SKETCH from the menu
Select INCLUDE LIBRARY
Select MANAGE LIBRARIES

This will launch pop-up window that manages libraris for the Arduino IDE.  In the search filter box (top right hand corner) enter these terms:

Adafruit_GFX
Adafruit_SSD1306

Choose INSTALL to install both of these libraries.

Once this is done press the VERIFY button on the Arduino IDE and ensure that you can compile the code without errors.  Once you have that working you can begin playing with the code and adding functionality.  If you come up with something interesting please share it with us and we'll be happy to add it here and give you credit!  :-)
